\noindent Please note: Abbreviations should be introduced at the first mention in the main text â€“ no abbreviations lists. Suggested structure of main text (not enforced) is provided below.

\section*{Introduction}

The Introduction section, of referenced text\cite{Figueredo:2009dg} expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable). The introduction should not include subheadings.

\section*{Results}

Up to three levels of \textbf{subheading} are permitted. Subheadings should not be numbered.

\subsubsection*{Third-level section}

Example text under a subsection. Bulleted lists may be used where appropriate, e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Third-level section}
 
Topical subheadings are allowed.

\section*{Discussion}

The Discussion should be succinct and must not contain subheadings.

\section*{Methods}

\subsubsection*{Neuron model}

\subsubsection*{Regulation model}

\subsubsection*{Growth model}

\subsubsection*{Segmenting space using Delaunay Triangulation}

\subsubsection*{Analuytical calculation of silent state }

\subsubsection*{Model implementation and code availability}

Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work.

\bibliography{sample}

\noindent LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command for an inline citation, e.g.  \cite{Hao:gidmaps:2014}.

For data citations of datasets uploaded to e.g. \emph{figshare}, please use the \verb|howpublished| option in the bib entry to specify the platform and the link, as in the \verb|Hao:gidmaps:2014| example in the sample bibliography file.

\section*{Acknowledgements (not compulsory)}

Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks to anonymous referees and editors, or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged.

\section*{Author contributions statement}

Must include all authors, identified by initials, for example:
A.A. conceived the experiment(s),  A.A. and B.A. conducted the experiment(s), C.A. and D.A. analysed the results.  All authors reviewed the manuscript. 

\section*{Additional information}

To include, in this order: \textbf{Accession codes} (where applicable); \textbf{Competing interests} (mandatory statement). 

The corresponding author is responsible for submitting a \href{http://www.nature.com/srep/policies/index.html#competing}{competing interests statement} on behalf of all authors of the paper. This statement must be included in the submitted article file.

\caption{Changes in cell size can disrupt neuron dynamics, but can be compensated for by a mechanism that does not explicitly measure cell size. (a) Growth (here assumed to mean increasing the surface area of a cell, keeping the number of membrane proteins the same) can cause a tonically spiking cell to fall silent. (b) Firing rate of the neuron in (a) as a function of cell surface area and channel conductance. The dashed line corresponds to constant conductance density. Red arrow corresponds to size change in (a). (c) A simple biologically-plausible scheme to regulate channel conductances. Transcription of genes coding for channel proteins depends on intracellular calcium concentrations, which in turn determines protein abundances, which affect membrane potential, which feeds back onto intracellular calcium concentrations through voltage-gated calcium channels. (d) This mechanism regulates channel conductances, making the line of constant conductance density (dashed line) globally attractive. (e) Regulation of channel conductances during constant uniform (thin line) and exponential (thick line) growth.}
